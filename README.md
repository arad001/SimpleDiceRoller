# A simple dice roller made in python with tkinter

This is my first public project. It is just a dice
roller you can use. Feel free to commit any changes,
my code can have some rookie mistakes.

## NO NEED TO INSTALL DEPENDENCIES
you can run this in python without 
installing any pip package because
i used libraries that are included in every
python installation
